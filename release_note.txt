3) Added multi-language support, including Deutsch, Français, Español, Italiano, Português, Русский, Türkçe, 日本語, 中文(繁體), 한국어. You can set it in Settings > Maintenance > User Interface > Language.
4) Changed the default 802.1X mode from Force Authorized to Auto, to facilitate configuration of 802.1X.
5) Added support to log out of the Hotspot Manager.
6) Added support to customize the MAC address format for PPSK with RADIUS.
7) The following optimizations were made to the MAP function: added EAP antenna parameters and 6GHz band, supported modifying EAP mounting type and installation angle, supported copying AP and recording interception area for simulation result evaluation, and fixed some bugs.
8) Added the Site Permission for Administrators, to allow the creation or deletion of sites.
9) Allowed Administrators to export data (Setting > Services > Export Data).
10) Alert emails will be sent once when the same Email address is set for multiple accounts.
